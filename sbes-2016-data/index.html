      <h3 class="page-header" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

      <p class="text-justify">Code smells in a program represent indications of structural quality problems, which can be addressed by software refactoring. Refactoring is widely practiced by developers, and considerable development effort has been invested in refactoring tooling support. There is an explicit assumption that software refactoring improves the structural quality of a program by reducing its density of code smells. However, little has been reported about whether and to what extent developers successfully remove code smells through refactoring. This paper reports an empirical study intended to address this gap. We analyze how often refactorings affect the density of code smells along the version histories of 25 projects. Our findings are based on the analysis of 2,635 refactorings distributed in 11 different types. Surprisingly, 2,506 refactorings (95.1%) did not reduce code smells. Moreover, refactorings tended to induce new smells as often as removing existing smells. These findings suggest that practitioners should be careful when performing refactoring edits. In fact, several smells induced by refactoring edits tended to live long, and were only eventually removed when smelly elements became more complex and costly to get rid of.</p>

      <h3 class="page-header" id="examples">Motivating Examples</h3>

      <p class="text-justify">Code smells are anomalies in the program structure. A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system. There are different types of code smells documented in the literature <a href="#references">[1]</a>. For instance, lets suppose a single class with several responsibilities. A class with this symptom is hard to read and evolve. This type of smell is known as God Class. Another common anomaly is when a method has many parameters. This code smell is known as Long Parameter List. A method with this symptom is also hard to read and evolve.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">The structural quality of a program can be quantified by the occurrences of code smells on it. For instance, Figures 1 and 2 show the Person class in two different forms. In Figure 1, the Person class has at least three attributes representing two loosely-coupled concepts: person and telephone number. This version of Person can be considered a God Class. In order to remove this code smell, the developer can extract part of the class structure it into another class: TelephoneNumber (Figure 2). After this transformation, the program no longer has a God Class and still realize the same functionality. As the program have a code smell in Figure 1, its new internal structure represented in Figure 2 has a better structural quality.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">Projects with low structural quality are hard to read and maintain. Therefore, whenever a code smell is identified in a program, a change should be made to remove it. Refactoring is a structural change intended to remove a code smell without changing its observable behavior <a href="#references">[1]</a>. There are several claims associated with the benefits of software refactoring, which is all implicitly associated with its capability of improving the software structural quality.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">In fact, refactoring is a common practice <a href="#references">[3]</a> intended to improve code quality attributes <a href="#references">[2]</a>. Code smells are widely used for detecting refactoring opportunities <a href="#references">[4]</a>. Existing studies highlight that developers can use refactoring to improve structural quality by eliminating code smells in software <a href="#references">[5]</a> <a href="#references">[6]</a>. Let’s consider the Figures 1 and 2 again to illustrate this scenario. As mentioned before, the module Person in Figure 1 has a God Class code smell. This happened because this class is accumulating responsibilities that should be fulfilled by two classes. In order to address this smell, the Extract Class refactoring should be performed, i.e., a programmer could create a new class and move the relevant fields and methods from the old class into the new one. This refactoring, in this case, would remove the God Class code smell. Since the number of code smells would be reduced, this refactoring would improve the software structural quality.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">There is a list of refactoring types documented in literature <a href="#references">[1]</a>. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the Extract Class refactoring type. Another refactoring type is the Inline Temp. In order to use this refactoring, a temporary variable assigned to once with a simple expression must exist. Listing 1 presents a method responsible for deserializing a piece of JSON code into a Java object. This method uses a temporary variable (node) to return the desired value. This variable is used only in the next line of the method. Therefore, a developer could apply the Inline Temp refactoring to get rid of this variable. As result of this refactoring, the node variable disappears and the resulting method only contains one line (Listing 2).</p>




      <p class="text-justify">The aforementioned refactoring application illustrates a scenario where refactoring was not fully successful in improving structural quality. In this case, a new code smell was introduced by the code change being accomplished by the programmer. The code presented in Listing 1 has no code smells, but the resulting code presented in Listing 2 has one. A call to getCodec method is firstly made. After that, three additional method calls are made in the same chain. This is a code smell know as Message Chain. Navigating through method calls this way means the code is coupled to the structure of the navigation. Therefore, any change in the object graph structure would affect this piece of code. In practice, refactoring may not be effective in some cases as this example illustrates. In this way, refactoring may not improve or maintain the structural quality and, worse, it may introduce new code smells. Lets consider again Listings 1 and 2. In this scenario, the Inline Temp refactoring removed an apparently unnecessary temporary variable, but introduced a new code smell on the software. Consequently, this refactoring degraded the program structural quality. This is an example of how refactoring may not be effective.</p>


      <h3 class="page-header" id="classification">Refactoring Classification</h3>

      <p class="text-justify">Both aforementioned examples presented cases where refac- torings have had interference on the existence of code smells. Code smells were removed in the first case (Figures 1 and 2). In the second case, a new code smell instance emerged. These scenarios show how refactoring can interfere positively or negatively in the existence of code smells. The applica- tion of a refactoring may contribute to the degradation of structural quality (Listings 1 and 2). In this way, we can classify a single refactoring by looking how it changed the existing code smells. In order to show how this can be made, lets formally define it.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">Let S = {s<sub>1</sub>,s<sub>2</sub>,···,s<sub>n</sub>} be the set of software projects to be evaluated. Each software s has a set of versions V(s) = {v1, v2, &hellip; , v<sub>m</sub>}. Each version vi has a set of elements E(v<sub>i</sub>) = {e<sub>1</sub>, e<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;} representing all methods, classes and fields belonging to it. In Figures 1 and 2, the set S = {PhoneBook} is composed just by one software. This software PhoneBook has two versions V(PhoneBook) = {v<sub>a</sub>, v<sub>b</sub>} represented by Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Finally, each version vi<sub>i</sub> has a set of elements E(v<sub>i</sub>) composed by Person and TelephoneNumber classes, methods and fields.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">In order to be able to detect refactorings we must analyze transformations between each subsequent pair of versions. In this way, we assume R is a refactoring detection function where R(v<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i+1</sub>) = {r<sub>1</sub>(rt<sub>1</sub>; e<sub>1</sub>), &hellip;, r<sub>k</sub>(rt<sub>k</sub>; e<sub>k</sub>)} gives us a set of tuples composed by two elements: the refactoring type (rt) and the set of refactored elements represented by e. So, the function R give us all refactoring activities detected in a pair of software versions. If we apply the R function in the PhoneBook software, the result would be R(v<sub>a</sub>,v<sub>b</sub>) = {r<sub>1</sub>(Extract Class,e')} where e' = {Person, TelephoneNumber}.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">In this work, it is considered as refactored elements all those directly affected by the refactoring. If a refactoring is applied only in a method body, only this method is considered as refactored element. For instance, lets consider a Move Method refactoring. In this refactoring type,
a method m is moved from class A to B. Hence, the considered refactored elements in this case would be {m, A, B}. All m method callers are affected by this refactoring, but we do not consider they as refactored elements. This is a limitation of the tools used. As another example, lets consider the Rename Method refactoring. In this scenario, a new name is given to the method m and the refactored element set would be just {m}. For each refactoring type a different refactored element set is used.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">Let CS be a code smell detection function where CS(e) = {cs<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;} returns a set of code smells present in a software element set e. As the objective is to classify refactorings, the classifying procedure will only analyze code smells related to elements affected by a refactoring. In this way, we can say that CS<sub>b[r]</sub>(e) is the set of code smells of e before the application of the refactoring r. On the other hand, CS<sub>a[r]</sub>(e) is the set of code smells found after the application of r. Considering r<sub>1</sub> refactoring applied on classes of PhoneBook system, CS function would present the following results: CS<sub>b[r<sub>1</sub>]</sub>({Person}) = {God Class} and CS<sub>a[r<sub>1</sub>]</sub>({Person,TelephoneNumber}) = &empty;.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">Using data collected by the functions defined before, it is possible to classify a refactoring by looking how it interferes in existing code smells. Suppose e is a software element set, r is a refactoring activity and |CS<sub>b[r]</sub>(e)|= x. After r refactoring, |CS<sub>a[r]</sub>(e)|= y. Depending on x and y, it is possible to classify r. If x > y, r reduced the number of code smells on e and, because of that, r is a <strong>positive refactoring</strong>. In other way, if x &lt; y, r increased the number of code smells on e and, because of that, r is a <strong>negative refactoring</strong>. When x = y, r is a <strong>neutral refactoring</strong>. This classification is summarized in the following table.</p>

    <h3 class="page-header" id="thresholds">Thresholds</h3>
    <p class="text-justify"> <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540244295">Lanza et al.</a> originally proposed the rules presented in the following tables. <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6498466&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6498466">Macia et al.</a> adapted these rules and evaluated the thresholds in another work. Two sets of thresholds were used in order to collect code smells. The first set, as known as <strong>pessimistic</strong>, represent the thresholds previously validated in the study by <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6498466&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6498466">Macia et al.</a>. We quality this strategy as pessimistic because it relies on the use of high thresholds values aiming to detect only critical code smells across the projects. The second strategy, named as <strong>optimistic</strong>, uses relaxed thresholds aiming to detect as many code smells as possible. These optimistic thresholds represent lower bound thresholds, which were tuned through our validation phase. These two strategies allowed to derive refactoring classifications based on two different sets of code smells. The following table presents all thresholds used during code smell detection phase.</p>
